  This enables end users to configure additional prometheus exporters for the collector's telemetry
  via the `metric_readers` configuration option. Configuring prometheus through the existing method
  of setting the service::metrics::address will continue to work, and only log a warning for users
  who have enabled the `telemetry.useOtelWithSDKConfigurationForInternalTelemetry` feature gate.
